# The-Model
This repository contains source code and documentation of my role in the graduation project.
Overview about the project: A pan and tilt system for real time tracking of rigid and non-rigid objects. 
An object is assumed to have a consistent color within any given frame but can experience color variations in the interframe time.
Also during this time, the object contour could change due to the change in the location, orientation or due to the changeable nature of
the object shape itself.
